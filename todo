now can login but db.sqlite3 shared between runs (add to build so it moves db.sqlite3 to a timestamp )

basically the docker compose part does not execute any commands that work on the containers ok apart from the run app bit need to work out why.

maybe look at other examples in github for example 

this di done but using /code rather than /app which is mounted by compose

so now need a way to check file changes and update the daemon there is a method 

add remove db switch in build and maybe a no rebuild option (look at repo)
https://github.com/morninj/django-docker/blob/master/config.ini.sample

rejig dockerfile to see if it can be quicker frequent changes right at bottom if possible



variables to set environment:

dev.build works need to add in dynamically set variable


merge  build and dev.build
      dockercompose and devdockcercompose
      dockerfile and devdockerfile

set debug from build

check the repo after and document

need to add dynamic removal of db on flag
